## Data Processing
[Why do we noramalize image by subtracting dataset's image mean](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/211436/why-do-we-normalize-images-by-subtracting-the-datasets-image-mean-and-not-the-c)
## GAN
* [Ian Goodfellow's GAN recommendation list:](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/968242968007200769)

  * Progressive GANs: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196 (probably the highest quality images so far) 
  * Spectral normalization: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT-&noteId=BkxnM1TrM … (got GANs working on lots of classes, which has been hard) 
        3. Projection discriminator: https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByS1VpgRZ … (from the same lab as #2, both techniques work well together, overall give very good results with 1000 classes) Here’s the video of putting the two methods together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=r6zZPn-6dPY 
        4. pix2pixHD (GANs for 2-megapixel video) https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11585

        5. Are GANs created equal? https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10337 A big empirical study showing the importance of good rigorous empirical work and how a lot of the GAN variants don’t seem to actually offer improvements in practice 
        6. WGAN-GP https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028 : probably the most popular GAN variant today and seems to be pretty good in my opinion. Caveat: the baseline GAN variants should not perform nearly as badly as this paper claims, especially the text one 
        7. StackGAN++: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10916 High quality text-to-image synthesis with GANs 
        8. Making all ML algorithms differentially private by training them on fake private data generated by GANs https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/05/159756 
        9. You should be a little bit aware of the “GANs with encoders” space, one of my favorites is https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04722 
        10. You should be a little bit aware of the “theory of GAN convergence” space, one of my favorites is https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04156
